# OOD

## SOLID 

* Single responsibility 
* Open for extension, close for modification 
* Liskov substitution \(subclass can do what all interface can do\)
* Interface segregation \(separate interface as granular as possible\) 
* Dependency inversion \(abstract should not depend on concrete, high-level class should not depend on low-level class\)

## Common Problem

#### 管理类 Management System

* Elevator
* Parking lot

#### 预定类 Reservation System

* Hotel reservation

#### 实物类 Real Life Object

* Vending machine

#### 游戏棋牌类 Games

## Design Pattern

#### Singleton Factory Method 

* make method abstract; 
* delegate the concrete action to subclass 

#### Simple Factory 

* extract the creating of object to another class 

#### Abstract Factory 

#### Builder 

#### Specification 

* abstract policies; 
* separate each condition chunk into a concrete specification

#### Strategy
