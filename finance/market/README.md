# Financial Market



## Market

* The word “Market” can have many different meanings. \* But it is used most often to denote both “The primary market” and “The secondary market”.
* Knowing what is the primary market and secondary markets is the key to understand how stocks trade.

### Primary Market

* The primary market is where securities are created.
* It's in this market that firms sell \(float\) new stocks and bonds to the public for the first time.
* For our purposes, you can think of the primary market as being synonymous with an Initial public offering\(IPO\).
* Simply put, an IPO occurs when a private company sells stocks to the public for the first time.

### Secondary Market

* A Secondary Market is the place where the created securities are traded among investors.
* That is, in the secondary market, investors trade previously issued securities without the issuing companies' involvement.
* The secondary market is what people are talking about when they refer to the "stock market".
* This includes the New York Stock Exchange \(NYSE\), Nasdaq\(National association of securities dealers automated quotation system\) and all major exchanges around the world.

### Risk Free rate of return

* The theoretical rate of return of an investment with zero risk. The risk-free rate represents the interest an investor would expect from an absolutely risk-free investment over a specified period of time.
* In practice, however, the risk-free rate does not exist because even the safest investments carry a very small amount of risk. Thus, the interest rate on a three-month U.S. Treasury bill is often used as the risk-free rate.

## Derivatives

* Derivatives is a risk-shifting agreement, the value of which is derived from the value of an underlying asset. The underlying asset could be a physical commodity, an interest rate, a company’s stock, a stock index, a currency, or virtually any other tradable instrument upon which two parties can agree.

### Derivatives Categories

* **OTC Derivative:** Customized privately negotiated derivatives.
* **Exchange Traded Derivative:** Standardized category of derivatives.
* Broad types of derivatives are

### Forwards

* Forward is a contract between buyer and seller-
  * To deliver some goods / Assets at a particular price at a future date, the price being fixed right now.
  * On the delivery date, the buyer pays the price and receives the asset/goods.

#### Forwards Example

* You are a trader of fruits:
* You enter into a contract with a farmer to deliver 1000 kilograms of apples at 100 per kilo, 3 months from now.
* That’s a forward contract.
* Apples are the underlying \(Specified asset\)
* Rs.100 per kilo is the specified/delivery price.
* 3 months is the specified future date / Expiry date.

![der110.png](http://wiki-na.ms.com/pub/OTCqa/Derivatives/der110.png)

* If the spot price of apple rises on the delivery date, the farmer misses the opportunity of extra profits.
* And if the price declines, the trader will be paying more than it would.
  * Hence, a forward agreement limits the risk and potential rewards. Ideal for hedging purposes.

Problem may arise if one of the participant fails to perform

* The fruit trader may go bankrupt.
* The farmer can go bust.
* Or the farmer might not be able to harvest 1000 kg of apple because of bad weather.
  * More importantly, whichever way the apple price moves, either the trader or the farmer has an incentive to default.

### Futures

* A contractual agreement to
  * buy or sell a particular commodity or financial instrument at a pre-determined price in the future.
  * Futures contracts detail the quality and quantity of the underlying asset.
  * They are standardized to facilitate trading on a futures exchange.
  * Some futures contracts may call for physical delivery of the asset, while others are settled in cash
  * Futures are standardized forwards contracts that are traded on an exchange.
  * An example is a soybean futures contract in which parties agree to deliver a certain amount of soybean at a certain price in the future.

### Diff b/w Futures and Forwards

### Options

* Options is an agreement that gives the buyer, who pays a fee \(premium\), the right – but not the obligation – to buy or sell a specified amount of an underlying asset at an agreed upon price \(strike or exercise price\) on or until the expiration of the contract \(expiry\).
* A call option is an option to buy.
* A put option is an option to sell.
* **Call option:**

A call option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to buy an asset by a certain date for a certain price.

![call.png](http://wiki-na.ms.com/pub/OTCqa/Derivatives/call.png)

* **Put option:**

A put option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to sell an asset by a certain date for a certain price.

![put.png](http://wiki-na.ms.com/pub/OTCqa/Derivatives/put.png)

#### Example of a Call option

* Let’s say IBM stock is currently trading at $100 per share.
  * An investor purchases one call option contract on IBM with a $100 strike and at a price of $2.00 per contract.\(Contract is for 100 shares, so 100 X $2 = $200\)
* Let us see what will happen to the value of this call when the option expires
  * In The Money \(ITM\)
  * At The Money \(ATM\)
  * Out of The Money \(OTM\)
* When option expires, IBM trading at $105 In the Money.
  * Remember, call option gives the buyer the right to purchase shares of IBM at $100 per share.
  * So buyer could use the option to purchase those shares at $100, then immediately sell those same shares in the open market for $105.
  * Because of the intrinsic value of the option, the options can be sold for $5 \(Intrinsic value = \(Market rate of IBM – strike price\) = \($105 - $100\) = $5\)
  * This will amount to a total sale price of $500 \(5 x 100\)
  * Purchase price of the option is $200.
  * The net profit to the buyer from this trade will be $300.
* When option expires, IBM trading at $101 At the Money.
  * Using the same analysis as shown above, the call option will now be worth $1 \(or $100 total\).
  * Since the investor spent $200 to purchase the option in the first place,
  * He or she will show a net loss on this trade of $1.00 \(or $100 total\).
* When option expires, IBM trading at $100 or below Out of the Money.
  * The option buyer will lose 100% of his or her money.
  * In this case, The full $200 spent on buying the option will be lost.

#### Buyer and Writer of an Option

* The buyer of an option is the one who by paying the option premium buys the right but not the obligation to exercise his option on the seller/writer
* The writer of an option is the one who receives the option premium and is thereby obliged to sell/buy the asset if the buyer wishes to exercise his option.

#### Option Types

* American Option: American options are options that can be exercised at any time up to the expiration date
* European option: European options are options that can be exercised only on the expiration date itself.
* Bermudan Option: Bermudan options are options that can be exercised on specific dates through the life of the transaction.

#### Strategies in Options

* Basic strategies used in option trading
  * Collar
  * Straddle
  * Dispersion
  * Diagonal

#### Option Strategy - Collar

* The Collar is a good strategy to use if the investor is writing covered calls to earn premiums but wishes to protect himself from an unexpected sharp drop in the price of the underlying security.
* A collar strategy can be adopted when the investor is conservatively bullish.
* A Collar strategy involves buying a stock, insuring against the downside by buying a ATM put.
* And then financing\(Partly\) the put by selling a OTM call.

**Example of A Collar**

* Suppose an investor Mr. A buys or is holding ABC Ltd. currently trading at Rs.4758.
* He decides to establish a collar by writing a Call of strike price Rs.5000 for Rs.39.
* while simultaneously purchasing a Rs.4700 strike price Put for Rs.27.
* Since he pays Rs.4758 for the stock ABC Ltd., another Rs.27 for the Put but receives Rs.39 for selling the Call option.
* His total investment is Rs.4746.

![101.png](http://wiki-na.ms.com/pub/OTCqa/Derivatives/101.png)

* If the price of ABC Ltd. rises to Rs. 5100 after a month, then,
  1. Mr. A will sell the stock at Rs.5100 earning him a profit of Rs.342 \(Rs.5100 – Rs.4758\)

b. Mr. A will get exercised on the Call he sold and will have to pay Rs.100.

c. The Put will expire worthless.

d. Net premium received for the Collar is Rs.12.

e. Adding \(a + b + d\) = Rs.342 -100 – 12 = Rs.254

This is the maximum return on the collar strategy.

* However, the downside risk here is also limited :
* If the price of ABC Ltd. falls to Rs.4400 after a month, then,
  1. Mr. A loses Rs.358 on the stock ABC Ltd.

b.The Call expires worthless.

c.The Put can be exercised by Mr. A and he will earn Rs. 300.

d. Net premium received for the Collar is Rs.12.

e. Adding \(a + b + d\) = - Rs.358 + 300 +12 = - Rs.46

* This is the maximum the investor can loose on the Collar strategy.

#### Option Strategy - Straddle

* A Straddle is a volatility strategy and is used when the stock price / index is expected to show large movements.
* When the investor thinks that the underlying stock / index will experience significant volatility in the near term.
* This strategy involves buying a call as well as put on the same stock / index for the same maturity and strike price, to take advantage of a movement in either direction.

**Example of a Straddle**

* Suppose Nifty is at 4450 on 27th April.
* An investor, Mr. A enters a long straddle
* By buying a May Rs. 4500 Nifty Put for Rs. 85
* And a May Rs. 4500 Nifty Call for Rs. 122.
* The net debit taken to enter the trade is Rs 207.
* Which is also his maximum possible loss.

![102.png](http://wiki-na.ms.com/pub/OTCqa/Derivatives/102.png)

![103.png](http://wiki-na.ms.com/pub/OTCqa/Derivatives/103.png)

#### Option Strategy - Dispersion

* Dispersion refers to trades in which one
  * Sells index options and buys option on the index components or
  * Buys index and sells options in the index components.

**Example of Dispersion**

* Let us construct our own index out of six stocks
  * Let us call it the “Dew Jeans 6” or DJ6.
  * Here are the 6 stock symbols:

![104.png](http://wiki-na.ms.com/pub/OTCqa/Derivatives/104.png)

* Index = sum of parts
  * If 1 share of each of the individual names were purchased, the portfolio would cost $300.
  * If MMM fell to $98, both the portfolio and the Index would equal $298.
  * Simplistically if someone purchased the parts, and “shorted” the index, there would be no economic exposure…the “short” would hedge the portfolio for any outcome.
* With “dispersion” of prices, the portfolio receives $6,

![105.png](http://wiki-na.ms.com/pub/OTCqa/Derivatives/105.png)

The short index Put position pays $1. Net increase of $5.

_**Dispersion**_

* Dispersion is the opposite of Correlation.
* When the underlying securities move together, there is no difference in the final cash payout of this portfolio. That moving together is correlation.
* To be “long dispersion” is to be “short correlation”

#### Option Strategy - Diagonal

* An option strategy established by entering into long and short position in two options of the same type\(two call or two put\) but with different strike prices and expiration dates.
* Example of Diagonal spread:
  * Suppose a stock is trading at 30/- in July.
  * Sell August expiry Call with strike price of 34 @ Rs.6/-
  * Buy October expiry call with the strike price 26 @ Rs.4/-

## SWAPS

* Swaps are agreements between two counterparties to exchange cash flows in the future according to predetermined formula.
  * The notional is the principal or core value.
  * The notional value is used to calculate the service payments that will be exchanged between the two parties.
  * The contracting parties are called counterparties.
  * Bid-ask spread or pay-receive spread is what the swap dealers receive for their services. It is the difference between the cash flow one counterparty pays to the dealer and what dealer pays out to the other counterparty.

![swap.png](http://wiki-na.ms.com/pub/OTCqa/Derivatives/swap.png)

### IR Swaps

* Typical uses of an IRS:
  * Converting a liability/Investment from
  * Fixed rate to floating rate or
  * Floating rate to fixed rate. ![der14.png](http://wiki-na.ms.com/pub/OTCqa/Derivatives/der14.png)

### FX Swaps

* FX / Currency swap involves two parties that exchange a notional principal with one another in order to gain exposure to a desired currency. Following the initial notional exchange, periodic cash flows are exchanged in the appropriate currency.
* Example of FX SWAP:
  * An American multinational company \(Company A\) may wish to expand its operations into Brazil.
  * Simultaneously, a Brazilian company \(Company B\) is seeking entrance into the U.S. market.
  * Brazilians are not willing to extend loans to international corporations. In order to take out a loan in Brazil, Company A might be subject to a high interest rate of 10%.
  * Likewise, Company B will not be able to attain a loan with a favourable interest rate in the U.S. market.
  * The Brazilian Company may only be able to obtain credit at 9%.
  * Based on the companies competitive advantages of borrowing in their domestic markets.
  * Company A will borrow the funds that Company B needs from an American bank at 4% interest, while Company B borrows the funds that Company A will need through a Brazilian Bank at 5% interest.
  * The loans are then swapped.
  * Assuming that the exchange rate between Brazil \(BRL\) and the U.S \(USD\) is 1.60BRL/1.00 USD and that both Company’s require the same equivalent amount of funding, the Brazilian company receives $100 million from its American counterpart in exchange for 160 million real; these notional amounts are swapped.

![der13.png](http://wiki-na.ms.com/pub/OTCqa/Derivatives/der13.png)

### Commodities Swaps

* In commodity swaps, the cash flows to be exchanged are linked to commodity prices. Commodities are physical assets such as metals, energy and agriculture.
* A company that uses commodities as input may find its profits becoming very volatile if the commodity prices become volatile.
* So Commodity swaps can be used for hedging against Fluctuations in commodity prices.
* This is particularly so when the output prices may not change as frequently as the commodity prices change. In such cases, the company would enter into a swap whereby it receives payment linked to commodity prices and pays a fixed rate in exchange.
* Example of Commodity Swaps

consider a commodity swap involving a notional principal of 1,00,000 barrels of crude oil. One party agrees to make fixed semi-annual payments at a fixed price of Rs 2,500/bbl, and receive floating payments. On the first settlement date, if the spot price of crude oil is Rs 2,400/bbl, the pay-fixed party must pay \(Rs 2,500/bbl\)\*\(1, 00,000 bbl\) = Rs 2,50,000,000. The pay-fixed party also receives \(Rs 2,400/bbl\)\*\(1, 00,000 bbl\) =Rs 2,40,000,000. The net payment made \(cash out flow for the pay-fixed party\) is then Rs 10,000,000. In a different scenario, if the price per barrel will have increased to Rs 2,550/bbl than the pay-fixed party would have received a net inflow of Rs 5,000,000.

### Equity Swaps

* An equity swap is an agreement between counterparties to exchange a set of payments, determined by a stock or index return, with another set of payments \(usually an interest-bearing \(fixed or floating rate\) instrument, but they can also be the return on another stock or index\).
* Equity swaps are used to substitute for a direct transaction in stock.
* The two cash flows are usually referred to as "legs".
* The difference in the payment streams is netted.
* Example of an Equity Swaps
  * Notional Principal amount = $1 Million
  * Payments made semi annual
  * Fund manager will pay the broker/Dealer the return on the S&P 500 and will receive an interest payment of 5% every six months.
  * Index is at 10500, at the start of the swap.
* Results:
  * Six Months from now the index is at 11000.
    * The fixed payment the fund will receive is $1million\(0.05\) 182/365 = $24931.51/-
    * The index payment the fund must make is \(11000/10500 -1\) $ 1 million = $47619.04/-
  * The net payment the fund must make at the end of the first six months is $22687.50 \(47619.04-24931.51\)

### Credit Default Swaps

* A credit derivative transaction in which two parties enter into an agreement, whereby
* One party \(the Protection Buyer\) pays the other party \(the Protection Seller\) periodic payments for the specified life of the agreement
* The Protection Seller makes no payment unless a credit event relating to a predetermined reference asset occurs.
* If such an event occurs, it triggers the Protection Seller’s settlement obligation, which can be either cash or physical.
* It is a kind of insurance against credit risk.

#### Credit Events

* There are three broad categories of credit events that are put into the documentation of credit default swap contracts:
* _**Bankruptcy:**_ if a company goes into Chapter 11 \(in the US\) then that is a clear indicator that the company is in serious financial difficulty and that the bondholders may not get all their money back. This is an obvious thing to have triggered the payment in a CDS contract.
* _**Failure to pay:**_ If a company fails to make payments it should be making, including coupon payments on the bonds, then this can be documented as a credit event.
* _**Restructuring:**_ This is where a company changes the payment schedules it makes on its bonds, usually with the agreement of the bondholders. It’s usually not to the bondholders’ advantage when this happens, and hence CDS contracts can be documented to cover this kind of restructuring as a credit event.

**Credit Default Swaps**

* More precisely
* One counterparty \(say party B\) pays a premium to the other party \(say party S\).
* which in return has to pay to B a certain payment if a default causes losses to B.
* It is common in the terminology of CDSs that the party B is called protection buyer and party S protection seller.
* 3 parties involved in: _The protection buyer_, _The protection seller_ and the _Reference entity._

## Types of Traders in Derivative market

* Three broad categories of traders are:

1. Hedgers
2. Speculators
3. Arbitrageurs

* Let us define them one by one-

### Hedgers

* Hedgers use derivatives to reduce the risk that they face from potential future movements in a market variable.
  * Suppose that it is 24 May 2010, and ImportCo, a US company, knows that it will have to pay £ 10 mn on 24 Aug 2010 for the goods purchased from a British supplier.
  * The three months USD-GBP forward quote is 1.4415.
  * ImportCo could hedge its foreign exchange risk by buying pounds from the financial institution in the 3 months forward market at 1.4415.
  * This would fix the price to be paid out to British exporter at $14,415,000
  * Consider another US company named ExportCo, who is exporting goods to UK and on 24 May 2010, it will have to receive £ 30 mn 3 months later.
  * ExportCo can hedge its foreign exchange risk by selling pounds in 3 months forward market at 1.4410.
  * This would have the effect of locking in the USD to be realized for the sterling at $ 43,230,000.
* Note that a company might do better if it chooses not to hedge than if it chooses to hedge.
* Alternatively it might do worse also.
* Consider ImportCo, if the exchange rate is 1.3 on Aug 24 and the company has not hedged.
* The £ 10 mn that it has to pay will cost $13,000,000 which is less than $14,415,000.
* On the other hand, if exchange rate is 1.5, the £ 10 mn will cost $ 15,000,000 – and the company will wish that it has hedged.
* _The purpose of hedging is to reduce risk. There is no guarantee that the outcome with hedging will be better than the outcome without hedging._

### Speculators

* Speculators use derivatives to bet on the future movements in a market variable.
* Speculators make bets or guesses on where they believe the market is headed. They are betting that the price of the asset will go up or they are betting that it will go down.
* For example, if a speculator believes that a stock is overpriced, he or she may short sell the stock and wait for the price of the stock to decline, at which point he or she will buy back the stock and receive a profit.
* Speculators are vulnerable of both downside and upside of the market.
* They are typically seen as Risk Lovers.

### Arbitrageurs

* Arbitrageurs takes off setting positions in two or more instruments to lock in a profit.
* The third important group of participants in Futures, Forwards and options.
* Arbitrage involves locking in a riskless profit by simultaneously entering into transactions in two or more markets.
  * Let us consider a stock that is traded on both NYSE and LSE.
  * Suppose the stock price is $140 in NYSE and £ 100 in LSE at the time the exchange rate is $1.4300 per pound.
  * An arbitrageur could simultaneously buy 100 shares of the stock in NY and sell them in LSE to obtain a risk free profit of:

  1. X \[\($1.43 X 100\) - $ 140\] = $300
* _In practice only very small arbitrage opportunities are observed in the prices that are quoted in most financial markets._

## Capital Markets Glossary

### Primary Market:

* A market that issues new securities on an exchange. Companies, governments and other groups obtain financing through debt or equity based securities. Also known as "new issue market" \(NIM\).

### Secondary Market:

### Present Value:

* The current value of a sum which is to be paid \(or received\) on a future date. It is calculated as the amount that would have to be invested today at a specified rate for a specified period to obtain a known amount at the end of the period. In effect, it is a method of compounding in reverse. Also called fair value.

### Subprime:

* The term used for lending to borrowers at a rate higher than the prime interest rate, reflecting their higher risk of default. Subprime borrowers typically have low credit scores due to prior bankruptcy, missed loan payments, home repossession and similar occurrences.
