# Phantom of the Pit

### Rule 1

IN A LOSING GAME SUCH AS TRADING, WE SHALL START AGAINST THE MAJORITY AND ASSUME - WE ARE WRONG UNTIL PROVEN CORRECT! \(We do not assume we are correct until proven wrong.\) POSITIONS ESTABLISHED MUST BE REDUCED AND REMOVED UNTIL OR UNLESS THE MARKET PROVES THE POSITION CORRECT

### Rule 2

PRESS YOUR WINNERS CORRECTLY WITHOUT EXCEPTION \(Must add position if proven correct, tricky for day trading\)
